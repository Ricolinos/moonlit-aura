/* Declarative model for any twist page (PLAN_MAESTRO.md S1.1 point 3):
 * a page is a title + a small array of pivots; each pivot is a
 * provider (count/get_row/on_select), not a data copy. The generic
 * list screen (metro_screen_list.c) can render and drive ANY page
 * built from this without knowing what it actually contains --
 * artists, videos, settings rows, whatever.
 *
 * Page titles and pivot names are enum metro_lang_id, NOT a resolved
 * const char* -- these tables are static const arrays (compile-time
 * initializers), and metro_lang_str() is a function call, not a
 * constant expression, so it can't appear in one. Whoever draws a
 * page/pivot resolves the id at that moment
 * (metro_draw_header()/metro_draw_pivots() do this internally), which
 * is also what makes metro_lang_set() take effect immediately on the
 * next redraw. Row title/subtitle have no such restriction -- get_row()
 * runs at draw time, so it can call metro_lang_str() directly. */
