/* R3-F1/DD-1 (M-062): generalized from R2-F2's photo-only
 * metro_photo_thumbs.c -- same two-layer design (RAM window + on-disk
 * cache under metro_settings_metro_cache_dir()), now parametrized by a
 * metro_thumb_source so R3-F3 (artist photos) and R3-F4 (quickplay
 * album art) each plug in their own "what's the key"/"how do I decode
 * this" without a second/third copy of the window+cache bookkeeping.
 * Only one grid is ever on screen at a time, so there's exactly ONE
 * shared RAM window/pending queue for all sources -- switching source
 * (leaving Photos for Artists, say) is a metro_thumbs_reset(), same as
 * before. See DECISIONS.md M-062 for why this shape (index-based
 * pending entries, not filename-based) instead of a thinner rename. */
