/* R5 (M-089): big anti-aliased glyphs as 8-bit coverage masks, generated
 * by firmware/tools/gen_icons.py (GLYPHS list) into metro_glyphs_table.c
 * and COMMITTED, same pattern as metro_icons_table.c. For the screens
 * that cannot touch the disk (USB) and need more than a 16px cell:
 * scaling the monochrome 16px mask up gives blocks; this is the SVG
 * rasterised at its final size with real anti-aliasing. Drawn with
 * metro_widgets_draw_glyph(): colour of the caller's choice blended over
 * whatever is behind, pixel by pixel (metro_fb_plot_alpha). */
